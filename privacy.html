        <div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Information you provide to us:</strong> We collect information you provide to us which includes:</li>
            <li>Information we collect automatically: We collect information about you and your use of our service, your interactions with us and our advertising, as well as information regarding your network, network devices, and your computer or other Netflix capable devices you might use to access our service (such as gaming systems, smart TVs, mobile devices, set top boxes, and other streaming media devices). This information includes:</li>
            <li>

      <div>
        <h2>Use of Information</h2>
        <p>We use information to provide, analyze, administer, enhance and personalize our services and marketing efforts, to process your registration, your orders and your payments, and to communicate with you on these and other topics. For example, we use such information to:</p>
        <ul>

          </li>
          <li>determine your general geographic location (such as your city, state/province, and postal code);
</li>
          <li>provide localized content;</li>
          <li>determine your ISP to support network troubleshooting for you (we also use aggregated ISP information for operational and business purposes);</li>
          <li>help us quickly and efficiently respond to inquiries and requests;</li>
          <li>coordinate with Partners on making the Netflix service available to members and providing information to non members about the availability of the Netflix service, based on the specific relationship you have with the Partner;</li>
          <li>secure our systems, prevent fraud and help us protect the security of Netflix accounts;</li>
          <li>prevent, detect and investigate potentially prohibited or illegal activities, including fraud, and to enforce our terms (such as determining whether and for which Netflix signup offers you are eligible and determining whether a particular device is permitted to use the account consistent with our Terms of Use);</li>
          <li>analyze and understand our audience, improve our service (including our user interface experiences and service performance) and optimize content selection, recommendation algorithms and delivery;</li>
          <li>communicate with you concerning our service so that we can send you news about Netflix, details about new features and content available on Netflix, special offers, promotional announcements, consumer surveys, and to assist you with operational requests such as password reset requests. These communications may be by various methods, such as email, push notifications, text message, online messaging channels, and matched identifier communications (described below). Please see the "Your Choices" section of this Privacy Statement to learn how to set or change your communications preferences.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our content recommendations system strives to predict what you will be in the mood to watch when you log in. However, our content recommendations system does not infer or attach socio-demographic information (like gender or race) to you. We have a Help article that explains how our content recommendations system works - spoilers: the biggest driver of these recommendations is what you actually choose to watch through our service. You can read the article at <span class="link"><a href="#">netflix.com/recommendations.</a></span></p>

        <h2>Disclosure of Information</h2>

          <li><strong>The Netflix family of companies:</strong> We share your information among the Netflix family of companies (<span class="link"><a href="#">help.netflix.com/legal/corpinfo</a></span>) as needed for: providing you with access to our services; providing customer support; making decisions about service improvements; content development; and for other purposes described in the Use of Information section of this Privacy Statement.</li>
          <li>Service Providers: We use other companies, agents or contractors ("Service Providers") to perform services on our behalf or to assist us with the provision of services to you.

          <li><strong>Partners:</strong> As described above, you may have a relationship with one or more of our Partners, in which case we may share certain information with them in order to coordinate with them on providing the Netflix service to members and providing information about the availability of the Netflix service.

          <li><strong>Promotional offers:</strong> We may offer joint promotions or programs that, in order for your participation, will require us to share your information with third parties. In fulfilling these types of promotions, we may share your name and other information in connection with fulfilling the incentive. Please note that these third parties are responsible for their own privacy practices.</li>
          <li><strong>Protection of Netflix and others:</strong> Netflix and its Service Providers may disclose and otherwise use your personal and other information where we or they reasonably believe such disclosure is needed to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, (b) enforce applicable terms of use, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address illegal or suspected illegal activities (including payment fraud), security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Netflix, its users or the public, as required or permitted by law.</li>
